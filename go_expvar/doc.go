// Package go_expvar allows for metrics exporting using the expvar package
// This to take note of are:
// 	- The labels applied to struct variables must be unique otherwise you
//    risk over writing a previously set variable
//  	- Stick to a naming convention like `polygraph:"package.class.(innerStructName)*.variable"`
//  - Any value that is nil once passed through the Publish function will be ignored
//  - Once something is added to Publish method, it can not be removed.
